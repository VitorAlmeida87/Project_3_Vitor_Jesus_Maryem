For your first Machine Learning project, you’ll build a regression model to predict house prices based on their characteristics. Please follow the steps below:

- Load the dataset.
- Explore the data to understand its structure — features, target variable, shape, and data types.
- Clean the dataset (handle duplicates, missing values, etc.).
- Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
- Explore correlations between the target and features, and among features. Include your interpretations.
- Handle categorical variables (encoding).
- Train baseline models such as Linear Regression and KNN Regressor.
- Evaluate the models using metrics like R² and MSE.


Improve your models:
- Data side: handle outliers, multicollinearity, feature selection, normalization/standardization, feature engineering, etc.
- Model side: try other models (especially ensemble methods) and perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Compare all models and select the best one.
- Identify which features most strongly influence house prices based on your best model.

Deliverables
- A Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis, code, and results.
- A Presentation (10 minutes) summarizing your ML process, insights, and final model.

Presentation Details
- All team members must present.
- Date : next Saturday
